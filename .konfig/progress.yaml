          the original reservation being cancelled and a refund will be issued
          to the credit card used to secure the booking. The modified
          reservation will then be charged to the credit card used to secure the
          booking and will show as a new charge. Property is not responsible for
          exchange rate differences due to charges and refunds. Guests under the
          age of 21 can only check in with a parent or official guardian. This
          property charges $150 per night for incidentals. This charge is fully
          refundable upon checkout pending approval from the property. Guests
          are requested to contact the property after booking 10 rooms or more,
          as such bookings may be subject to different terms and conditions.
          Extra beds may not be available for all rooms. For all reservations,
          unless otherwise stated, cancel by 12am 72 hours prior to arrival date
          to avoid a penalty of one night room charge and tax. Please contact
          the hotel directly with any group related questions. The Buffet
          accepts all major credit cards as well as debit cards. Cash is not
          accepted. You may also charge your Buffet experience to your guest
          room.
